This chapter contains overview and examples of some [Cucumber] and [Gherkin] features allowing to write tests in a more idiomatic and maintainable way.

Also, it's worth to become familiar with [Gherkin language][1].

2. [`Rule` keyword](rule.md)
3. [`Background` keyword](background.md)
4. [`Scenario Outline` keyword](scenario_outline.md)
